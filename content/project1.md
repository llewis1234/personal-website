In this project, I created a personal website using PicoCMS, a flexible and user-friendly flat-file content management system. The site was designed to showcase my skills and projects while providing a platform for ongoing updates and portfolio development. I successfully hosted the website on a Linode cloud instance running Ubuntu, demonstrating my ability to manage cloud infrastructure and deploy web applications. This project reflects my proficiency in web development, server management, and the implementation of modern technologies for effective online presence.
