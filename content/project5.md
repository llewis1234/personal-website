# Logistics Communication Generator App

In this project, I designed and implemented a simple application utilizing ChatGPT to streamline email composition at work. The application features user-friendly input boxes where users can provide key information, allowing the app to generate relevant subject lines and email bodies automatically. This tool not only enhances productivity by saving time on repetitive tasks but also improves the quality and consistency of communications. Through this project, I demonstrated my ability to leverage technologies to create practical solutions that address real-world challenges in the workplace.
