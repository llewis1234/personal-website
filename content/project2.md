# Cyber Skyline

I proudly participated in the National Cyber League's Cyber Skyline competition, a prestigious event designed to evaluate and enhance cybersecurity expertise. Competing against over 8,400 participants, I placed in the 96th percentile overall with a ranking of #376, with top scores in Enumeration & Exploitation (#220) and Cryptography (#301)  categories. This competition challenged me with real-world scenarios, including cryptography, network security, and vulnerability assessments, sharpening my technical skills and fostering critical problem-solving under pressure. These results reflect my dedication to continuous learning and excellence in cybersecurity, and I am eager to apply the insights gained to future challenges and opportunities in the field.
