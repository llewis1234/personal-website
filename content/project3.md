# Industry Certifications

I have independently pursued and attained multiple industry-recognized certifications, including CompTIA A+, Network+, Linux+, Security+, and ISC2 Certified in Cybersecurity. This self-directed study required mastering a wide range of topics, from IT fundamentals and networking principles to Linux systems and foundational cybersecurity concepts. Successfully passing these exams demonstrates my commitment to professional growth and my ability to tackle complex technical subjects. I am now actively preparing for future certifications to further expand my expertise in server management and infrastructure. This journey highlights my dedication to continuous learning and staying at the forefront of the dynamic field of information technology.
