# Industry Certifications

In this project, I independently pursued and achieved multiple certifications from CompTIA, including A+, Network+, and Linux+. This self-directed study involved a comprehensive understanding of IT fundamentals, networking principles, and Linux operating systems. I demonstrated commitment and discipline in mastering complex topics and successfully passing the associated exams. Currently, I am actively preparing for Security+ and Server+ certifications, further enhancing my skills and knowledge in cybersecurity and server management. This journey underscores my dedication to professional development and continuous learning in the ever-evolving field of information technology.
