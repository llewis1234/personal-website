   I am currently pursuing my degree in Computer Science & Information Systems at Metropolitan Community Colleges of Kansas City, a school recognized by the National Security Agency as a National Center of Academic Excellence in Cyber Defense (CAE-CD) through 2028. This prestigious designation reflects the quality of the cybersecurity education I am receiving as I continue to build my expertise in network security, systems administration, and cyber defense.
   
   Alongside my studies, I am employed as a remote Asset Coordinator, where I manage the logistics of A/V production equipment for large-scale events such as concerts, conventions, and corporate gatherings. This role has honed my organizational skills and given me experience working across multiple industries, helping to ensure that each eventâ€™s technical needs are met efficiently.
   
   Returning to school to further my education has been a pivotal step in my career development. My goal is to merge my technical expertise with my hands-on experience to contribute meaningfully in the fields of cybersecurity and IT infrastructure.
