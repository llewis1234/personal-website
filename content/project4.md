I made the decision to go back to school to further my education and enhance my career prospects by pursuing a degree in Secure Systems Administration and Engineering (Cybersecurity). This journey has allowed me to dive deep into subjects like network security, systems administration, and risk management. Balancing academics with my professional work has strengthened my time management skills and reinforced my commitment to continuous learning. This experience is equipping me with the knowledge and credentials to thrive in todayâ€™s fast-evolving tech industry.
